The Aim of this Bio is to please the eyes of those who came to my profile by some chance. I am amazed by the intimidation of knowledge. It is not easy to get inspired to gain knowledge. Maybe my repository helps you to get a little bit inspired in your work or life. 😅

### Poetic form to express the fact above
Knowledge is a tapestry woven in layers, <br>
Where wisdom's threads entwine with care.<br>
The surface reveals but a glimpse so bright,<br>
Yet depths await, hidden from sight.<br>

Through the veil of the first layer's grace,<br>
A second one whispers, a secret place.<br>
To grasp its essence, one must delve,<br>
Navigate the first to see oneself.<br>

Each layer a realm, a world to explore,<br>
Unlocking mysteries, revealing more.<br>
Knowledge unfurls in a dance so grand,<br>
A journey of mind, guided by hand.<br>
