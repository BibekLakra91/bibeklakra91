### Knowledge
```
Knowledge is a tapestry woven in layers, 
Where wisdom's threads entwine with care.
The surface reveals but a glimpse so bright,
Yet depths await, hidden from sight.

Through the veil of the first layer's grace,
A second one whispers, a secret place.
To grasp its essence, one must delve,
Navigate the first to see oneself.

Each layer a realm, a world to explore,
Unlocking mysteries, revealing more.
Knowledge unfurls in a dance so grand,
A journey of mind, guided by hand.
